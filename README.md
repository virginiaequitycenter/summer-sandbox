* [Karl Broman's tutorial](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) (a favorite of mine, especially for setting up ssh; but GitHub now recommends authenticating using HTTPS and access tokens, so probably worth following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/set-up-git) for the git set up)
* [Udacity tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (this is supposed to make using git/github easier by avoiding the command line; I've not used it, though others are welcome to do so)
* [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) (these go into more detail and will become more useful once you're comfortable with some basics)
* [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) (R czar Jenny Bryan's concise e-book on using GitHub with R/RStudio - JGG)
* [Learn Git Branching (Game!!)](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
* [Dangit, Git!?!](https://dangitgit.com/en) (Plain-English solutions to common git problems; e.g., "Dangit, I did something terribly wrong, please tell me git has a magic time machine!?!" - JGG)
