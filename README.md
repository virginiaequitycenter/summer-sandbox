A repo for equity center research fellows to practice with GitHub! 

## GitHub resources

(If you find/have one you like, add it here!)

* [Karl Broman's tutorial](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) (a favorite of mine, especially for setting up ssh; but GitHub now recommends authenticating using HTTPS and access tokens, so probably worth following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/set-up-git) for the git set up)
* [Udacity tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (this is supposed to make using git/github easier by avoiding the command line; I've not used it, though others are welcome to do so)
* [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) (these go into more detail and will become more useful once you're comfortable with some basics)

## Git resources

* [Software Carpentry lesson on version control with git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

## Markdown resources

* [GitHub's Mastering Markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
