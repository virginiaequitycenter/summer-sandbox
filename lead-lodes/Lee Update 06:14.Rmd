# June 14

I familiarized myself with the following datasources: Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES). The structure for each dataset is shown below. I also used [Jacob's handy-dandy function](https://github.com/jacob-gg/manager) to check for missing data! In instances where there were no missing data, I removed that line of code. Everything shown below is based on the csv's available for download from each of these sources---I've done no data cleaning or re-formatting.

## LEAD
Four different data files are available for the state of VA: (1) Census tracts energy data with Area Median Income (AMI), (2) Census tracts energy data with % Federal Poverty Level (FPL), (3) State, counties, and cities energy data with AMI, and (3) State, counties, and cities energy dat with % FPL. Below, I show the structures and missing data information for datasets 1 ("leaddat1") and 3 ("leaddat3"). 

#### Abridged data dictionary:
* FIP: state, county, or city
* TEN: Owner or renter
* YBL6: Year of building construction
* BLD: Number of units in the building
* HFL INDEX: Primary heating fuel type
* AMI68: % Area Median Income
* FPL15: % Federal Poverty Level
* SMI68: % State Median Income 
* HINCP: Avg. Annual household income ($/year)
* ELEP: Avg. household annnual electricity expenditure ($/year)
* GASP: Avg. household annual gas expenditure ($/year)
* FULP: Avg. household annual other fuel expenditure ($/year)

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacob-gg/manager/main/R/loch_missingness_monster.R')
setwd("/Users/Carlson/Desktop/Equity Center Data Exploration")
leaddat1 <- read.csv("VA AMI Census Tracts 2018.csv")
leaddat3 <- read.csv("VA SMI State, Counties, Cities 2018.csv")
lodesOD <- read.csv("va_od_aux_JT00_2002.csv")
lodesRAC <- read.csv("va_rac_S000_JT00_2002.csv")
lodesWAC <- read.csv("va_wac_S000_JT00_2002.csv")
```

``` {r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
str(leaddat1)
loch_missingness_monster(leaddat1)
str(leaddat3)
loch_missingness_monster(leaddat3)
```

## LODES
Per the website, "Data files are state-based and organized into three types: Origin-Destination (OD), Residence Area Characteristics (RAC), and Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC), all at census block geographic detail. Data is available for most states for the years 2002â€“2018." There are two versions of each of these---one using 2000 census blocks and one using 2010 census blocks. Below, I show the structures and missing data information for the 2010 versions for each dataset---OD ("lodesOD), RAC ("lodesRAC""), and WAC ("lodesRAC").

### Origin-Destination (OD)
#### Abridged data dictionary:
* S000: Total # of jobs
* SA01--SA03: # of jobs for different age groups
* SE01--SE03: # of jobs with different earnings per month
* S101--S103: # of jobs in different industries 

``` {r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
str(lodesOD)
```

### Residence Area Characteristics (RAC)
#### Abridged data dictionary:
* C000: Total # of jobs
* CA01--CA03: # of jobs for different age groups
* CE01--CE03: # of jobs with different earnings per month
* CNS01--CNS20: # of jobs in different NAICS sectors
* CR01--CR07: # of jobs for workers with different races
* CT01--CT02: # of jobs for Hispanic and non-Hispanic workers
* CD01--CD04: # of jobs by educational attainment
* CS01--CS02: # of jobs by sex

``` {r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
str(lodesRAC[,1:10])
```

### Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC)
#### Abridged data dictionary:
* First 42 columns: All of the same data as the RAC datafile
* CFA01--CFA05: # of jobs by firm age
* CFS01--CFS05: # of jobs by firm size 

``` {r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
str(lodesWAC[,1:10])
```
