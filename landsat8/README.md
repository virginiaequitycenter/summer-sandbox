## Working with Landsat 8 Data

Linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dimvOYZY2PiBhEunOD-YpNTxSWlQ9A-NvRkPDtUWj5c/edit?usp=sharing) are some general notes about the Landsat 8 data, such as how to access the data, what data is available, and how to start analyzing it.

To download Landsat 8 data, you will need to use EarthExplorer. Here's a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRBLFHK9prvqFHeuPPh2UPgurBMwa7ekNYX7pOqs-a4/edit?usp=sharing) to a (still in progress) tutorial for downloading data locally to your computer for analysis.
