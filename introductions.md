1. Is there anything that you hope others on this team can help you with?

2. What are you most excited about being able to do now that COVID is much less of a health concern (if you're vaccinated ofc)?


# June 15

1. Do you like to listen to music while you work? If so, drop links to those playlists!

* KK: I use Spotify and when I work/study, my usual go-tos are the Mac Miller, Noname, SZA, or Bob Marley radios; or the public playlist "park hangs" or this playlist I made for a class a few semester ago! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4xMwWiZ0nXjj0RS4q2Yi6h?si=847fe5141ee14ce5

* TO: I used to enjoy listening to music when I work but I found that I spent more time dancing in my chair and singing the songs than actually working. When I am in a loud environment though, I will turn on music to keep myself focused. Got into bi-neural beats for neurodiverse people like myself, turns out Mario and other gaming soundtracks work wonders for us. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Imf8Js69c1wSHDj837XDa?si=0216b33008a94b86

* ML: For the most part, I can't listen to music while I work because it's super distracting (even instrumental music is distracting - as a former band kid, I can't help but focus on which instruments are playing). Occasionally, when I'm in a super loud place, I'll listen to some low-key piano music, but I don't have a specific playlist I like.

* LL: I think one of the most noticable declines in my life since graduating college is that I often find it hard to focus on work if I listen to music now, whereas I used to not be able to concentrate unless I was listening to music. But, I still love music very much! My go-to artists are The National, Shakey Graves, Wild Child, My Morning Jacket, and Andrew Bird. I don't think any of those artists are on this playlist, but here's a playlist I quite like: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcTieYAg7jq1?si=5fef1180631b4442

* HL: Depends on what kind of work! I love listening to alternative or other lowkey music when it's not distracting. Find it hard to listen to music when writing or doing research though.

* JGG: Yes (a lot of the time)! While working, I tend toward instrumental music; I find vocals a bit distracting. Most of the time, it winds up being either jazz or relaxed electronic music. For jazz, some frequent suspects are [Brian Blade and the Fellowship Band](https://open.spotify.com/album/5InHDZVvNbDDvq917BmMgT?si=hSQScJGsQq-VBcae_Vj6Ew&dl_branch=1), [Paul Desmond](https://open.spotify.com/album/620p4tcAC1PAmDUY8Vk5KT?si=28uxbTJXQZSb-Y7MJVZ8qA&dl_branch=1), and [Wes Montgomery](https://open.spotify.com/album/77eTceYYxRjaRMTxSwiLtV?si=T0P-FlDoR5Kp8RLmjVDPvQ&dl_branch=1). Sometimes, a bit of 80s-infused electronic music can be [just the thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QKQlf8r7ls).

* MC: I used to listen to music in my office, but since I've been working from home -- in a shared space -- I've not  done so (I know I could wear headphones/earbuds or something, but find it uncomfortable for long periods). But I think I'd love some background music diluted by background coffee-house style noises, where I'd mostly tune it out but once in a while hone in on a lovely and new sound. That said, my past working music was heavy on the mandolin genre, often instrumental or with winding lyrics (the kind of thing Chris Thile does on the [Goat Rodeo](https://goatrodeo.lnk.to/notourfirstMW) series).

* AG: It depends on the work I'm doing - if it's anything where I have to really think deeply or problem solve, I prefer not to have music because it distracts me. I love studying in coffee shops for the background music and energy of having other people around me. When I'm doing less thought intensive work, I often listen to music. I like a wide variety of genres, but while working I mostly listen to chill R&B or indie type music. I really like finding new music through putting on suggested Spotify playlists.

* CD: I listen to a lot of music while I work. My main issue is that I listen to the same 3 songs for 2 weeks until I'm so sick of them I can't listen to them for a year. Currently, I'm really enjoying the album Dreamland by Glass Animals.

2. If you could be a villain but couldn't kill people just inconvenience the world unless you were paid, what would you do? Example, make everyones phone chargers so short they have to hold it to charge or pay you to get an extra foot of chord.

* KK: I would make people's alarm always go off at the wrong time unless I were paid. Maybe it would go off at 7PM instead of AM and make you late for work, or it would go off two hours early on your day off, something like that.


* TO: I would make all charging ports work at 30 percent capacity. So, charging a phone will take like 6-8 hours instead of 1 and you would have to pay to upgrade to a higher charge rate/capacity. Or (this is from a friend and I loved it) I would randomize food tastes. So, you would bite into an apple and it would taste like pizza but tomorrow an apple from the same batch could taste like pineapples. So you would never know what any food would taste like because it changes daily. (My addition to the idea) you could pay me daily to get a list of what different foods will taste like that day but only for 7 food items.

* ML: I would make it so that all music was ice-cream-truck music. Alarms, Spotify playlists, radios, etc. would only play the songs you hear on the ice cream truck. People would be allowed to turn off the music anytime they want, but anytime they wanted to listen to music, it would only be the annoying ice cream truck songs.

* LL: I would make it impossible to use Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, etc. just to see how many people don't know how to get places they go regularly because they rely on maps so much.

* HL: I would make all phones fall asleep for an hour for every hour of use to see if people would become more social.

* JGG: "Sorry, folks, look like we're going to be stuck here on the tarmac for another hour or so unless you all break out the pocketbooks."

* MC: I'm pretty sure as I villain I'd end up more in the Doofenschmirtz camp ("it's an -inator"), like a machine I could point at a corporation's building that would attract a pack of friendly but very loud barking dogs to the premises until they paid my ransom (see, no one is hurt, but I can attest one cannot do anything in the presence of a pack of friendly, insistently barking dogs).

* AG: This is an interesting question! I think I would make random objects weigh moderately more or less than they normally do, because I think it would be super disorienting. I'd also be curious to see how/if people developed new patterns to quickly assess weight and efficiently deal with this uncertainty.

* CD: I think I would want the ability to make people get something caught in the doorway as they pass through. Think like your headphones (back when headphones had wires) get caught on the doorknob and yanked out of your ear or like your pocket gets caught. This stuff happens infrequently to me but when it does I get so irrationally upset!

# June 7

1. Do you play any musical instruments? If so, tell us more! If not, what instrument(s) do you love to hear or would choose to learn if you had infinite time?

* MC: Yes, I've been learning mandolin for the last 12 years! And I just got a banjo!
* JGG: I started playing drums when I was around 10 years old, and for about a decade, that was how I spent as much of my time as I possibly could. In 2011, I took up steelpan and played semi-religiously for about 5 or so years, gigging around the Florida Panhandle at wedding receptions, business openings, etc. (Before I moved to Virginia, my only experience here was visiting to play in the [Virginia International Panfest](https://www.vapanfest.org/) a couple of times. Those were the days.) Recently, I’ve been playing shamefully little music; I have no excuse other than that steel pans are [expensive](http://www.mannetteinstruments.com/classical-series.html)!
* LL: I started taking piano lessons a little while ago. I am definitely still a beginner, but it has given me something fun to do during the pandemic and I am very grateful for that!
* ML: I've been playing the flute for about 12 years, and in the last few years, I've been teaching myself guitar and ukulele.
* CD: Unfortunately, I have no musical talent, but I would love to learn to play the piano or violin!
* HL: I play the piano, guitar, and ukulele quite a bit:) I also played the trumpet and trombone in elementary school and would love to try again if I ever get a chance..!
* TO: I tried learning the piano as a kid but my brain doesn't like my left hand doing different things from my right hand so I never went past playing with one hand. I picked up the guitar in college but couldn't get any good cause my teacher graduated. If I had infinite time I'd learn the piano, guitar, and bass guitar (I have always wanted to be the girl playing bass in red heels and lipstick.)
* KK: I am very musically challenged, but I love hearing the piano and violin and would say they are my favorite instruments
* AGC: Kind of! I played piano for about 4 years in elementary school, so I still semi-know how to do it and how to read music. I just learn to play songs I like occassionally! I also learned a little bit of guitar at one point.

2. Do you have any animals in your life? If you haven't had the pleasure of an animal companion, what animal(s) do you hope to one day know?

* JGG: Not currently (unfortunately). I lived with dogs for most of my life but not since moving to Charlottesville (the land of small “garden-level” apartments and no-pets lease clauses). A dog is hopefully inbound in the not-too-far-off future.
* MC: So many animals! Currently 3 dogs, 2 cats, and 3 chickens. Plus, we recently dug a frog pond in our yard and have verified a few new tenants.
* LL: I have an adorable and wise cat named Flop. My family adopted her when I was in middle school, so she's an old friend. I am always happy to share any of the __thousands__ of photos I have of her!
* ML: My family got two kittens at the beginning of the pandemic, and they are adorable! Their names are Bunsen and Beaker, and they are currently obsessed with "hunting" cicadas (aka meowing at them and getting paw prints all over the window).
* CD: My family has two dogs: Lilly and Harley! Lilly is a 14-year-old yellow lab/pitbull mix. She's the sweetest thing!  Harley is a 6-year-old black lab who is still a puppy at heart.
* HL: We are actually taking care of a teammate's Boa constrictor right now haha Quite a unique experience I must say!
* TO: Never had my own pet but lived with dogs with two ex SO's. I love dogs and whenever I decide to get one it will probably be a Husky or Husky mix of some kind, maybe a malamute.
* KK : Unfortunately no pets at the moment, but the coolest pet I've ever had was a monkey when I lived in Sierra Leone!
* AGC: Yes! I have a five year old doggy named Louie! We got him from the SPCA after fostering him - they told us he's a jack russel terrier mix, but the vet didn't know what he is, so we just call him a special mix. He's very cuddly and loves to go on walks.

3. What other questions would you suggest we ask?

* JGG: What kinds of workflows do you like or dislike? (Do you prefer doing most things via Slack/email, or are you big on face-to-face [Zoom-to-Zoom?] meetings? Do you prefer when team members work together semi-continuously, or is a once-a-week catch-up best for you?)
* LL: What are you already most comfortable/proficient doing in R (or whatever language you use), and what are you most eager to gain more practice doing?
* ML: Is there anything that you hope others on this team can help you with?
* CD: Do you like to listen to music while you work? If so, drop links to those playlists! More practically, what do you think are some code documentation best practices? What do you like to do when documenting your own code or what do you find most helpful when reading through a file that isn't your own?
* HL: Would people be comfortable setting up group meetings outside of the scheduled meeting times on Mondays to work together!?
* TO: Do you work at random times at night or have insomnia? Do you like working beside others without actually talking to them? Can we set up meetings if you are in this category to work together alone? Lastly, if you could be a villain but couldn't kill people just inconvenience the world unless you were paid, what would you do? Example, make everyones phone chargers so short they have to hold it to charge or pay you to get an extra foot of chord. (this is not mine just an example but I'd love to hear everyones)
* KK: How do you learn best? What are you passionate about?
* AGC:  What are you most excited about being able to do now that COVID is much less of a health concern (if you're vaccinated ofc)?
