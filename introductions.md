1. Do you like to listen to music while you work? If so, drop links to those playlists!

* KK: I use Spotify and when I work/study, my usual go-tos are the Mac Miller, Noname, SZA, or Bob Marley radios; or the public playlist "park hangs" or this playlist I made for a class a few semester ago! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4xMwWiZ0nXjj0RS4q2Yi6h?si=847fe5141ee14ce5

2. If you could be a villain but couldn't kill people just inconvenience the world unless you were paid, what would you do? Example, make everyones phone chargers so short they have to hold it to charge or pay you to get an extra foot of chord.

* KK: I would make people's alarm always go off at the wrong time unless I were paid. Maybe it would go off at 7PM instead of AM and make you late for work, or it would go off two hours early on your day off, something like that.

# June 7

1. Do you play any musical instruments? If so, tell us more! If not, what instrument(s) do you love to hear or would choose to learn if you had infinite time?

* MC: Yes, I've been learning mandolin for the last 12 years! And I just got a banjo!
* JGG: I started playing drums when I was around 10 years old, and for about a decade, that was how I spent as much of my time as I possibly could. In 2011, I took up steelpan and played semi-religiously for about 5 or so years, gigging around the Florida Panhandle at wedding receptions, business openings, etc. (Before I moved to Virginia, my only experience here was visiting to play in the [Virginia International Panfest](https://www.vapanfest.org/) a couple of times. Those were the days.) Recently, I’ve been playing shamefully little music; I have no excuse other than that steel pans are [expensive](http://www.mannetteinstruments.com/classical-series.html)!
* LL: I started taking piano lessons a little while ago. I am definitely still a beginner, but it has given me something fun to do during the pandemic and I am very grateful for that!
* ML: I've been playing the flute for about 12 years, and in the last few years, I've been teaching myself guitar and ukulele.
* CD: Unfortunately, I have no musical talent, but I would love to learn to play the piano or violin!
* HL: I play the piano, guitar, and ukulele quite a bit:) I also played the trumpet and trombone in elementary school and would love to try again if I ever get a chance..!
* TO: I tried learning the piano as a kid but my brain doesn't like my left hand doing different things from my right hand so I never went past playing with one hand. I picked up the guitar in college but couldn't get any good cause my teacher graduated. If I had infinite time I'd learn the piano, guitar, and bass guitar (I have always wanted to be the girl playing bass in red heels and lipstick.)
* KK: I am very musically challenged, but I love hearing the piano and violin and would say they are my favorite instruments
* AGC: Kind of! I played piano for about 4 years in elementary school, so I still semi-know how to do it and how to read music. I just learn to play songs I like occassionally! I also learned a little bit of guitar at one point.

2. Do you have any animals in your life? If you haven't had the pleasure of an animal companion, what animal(s) do you hope to one day know?

* JGG: Not currently (unfortunately). I lived with dogs for most of my life but not since moving to Charlottesville (the land of small “garden-level” apartments and no-pets lease clauses). A dog is hopefully inbound in the not-too-far-off future.
* MC: So many animals! Currently 3 dogs, 2 cats, and 3 chickens. Plus, we recently dug a frog pond in our yard and have verified a few new tenants.
* LL: I have an adorable and wise cat named Flop. My family adopted her when I was in middle school, so she's an old friend. I am always happy to share any of the __thousands__ of photos I have of her!
* ML: My family got two kittens at the beginning of the pandemic, and they are adorable! Their names are Bunsen and Beaker, and they are currently obsessed with "hunting" cicadas (aka meowing at them and getting paw prints all over the window).
* CD: My family has two dogs: Lilly and Harley! Lilly is a 14-year-old yellow lab/pitbull mix. She's the sweetest thing!  Harley is a 6-year-old black lab who is still a puppy at heart.
* HL: We are actually taking care of a teammate's Boa constrictor right now haha Quite a unique experience I must say!
* TO: Never had my own pet but lived with dogs with two ex SO's. I love dogs and whenever I decide to get one it will probably be a Husky or Husky mix of some kind, maybe a malamute.
* KK : Unfortunately no pets at the moment, but the coolest pet I've ever had was a monkey when I lived in Sierra Leone!
* AGC: Yes! I have a five year old doggy named Louie! We got him from the SPCA after fostering him - they told us he's a jack russel terrier mix, but the vet didn't know what he is, so we just call him a special mix. He's very cuddly and loves to go on walks.

3. What other questions would you suggest we ask?

* JGG: What kinds of workflows do you like or dislike? (Do you prefer doing most things via Slack/email, or are you big on face-to-face [Zoom-to-Zoom?] meetings? Do you prefer when team members work together semi-continuously, or is a once-a-week catch-up best for you?)
* LL: What are you already most comfortable/proficient doing in R (or whatever language you use), and what are you most eager to gain more practice doing?
* ML: Is there anything that you hope others on this team can help you with?
* CD: Do you like to listen to music while you work? If so, drop links to those playlists! More practically, what do you think are some code documentation best practices? What do you like to do when documenting your own code or what do you find most helpful when reading through a file that isn't your own?
* HL: Would people be comfortable setting up group meetings outside of the scheduled meeting times on Mondays to work together!?
* TO: Do you work at random times at night or have insomnia? Do you like working beside others without actually talking to them? Can we set up meetings if you are in this category to work together alone? Lastly, if you could be a villain but couldn't kill people just inconvenience the world unless you were paid, what would you do? Example, make everyones phone chargers so short they have to hold it to charge or pay you to get an extra foot of chord. (this is not mine just an example but I'd love to hear everyones)
* KK: How do you learn best? What are you passionate about?
* AGC:  What are you most excited about being able to do now that COVID is much less of a health concern (if you're vaccinated ofc)?
